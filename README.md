# 📊 Sales Analysis Using SQL Inside Python
## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to use SQL inside Python to perform basic sales analysis. A sales dataset is cleaned, loaded into a SQLite database, and queried to calculate total quantity sold, total revenue, and total profit by category. Finally, results are displayed using pandas and visualized with a simple bar chart.

## 🎯 Objective

Load sales data into SQLite using Python

Run SQL queries to compute sales metrics

Display SQL results using pandas

Create a basic bar chart for revenue visualization

Demonstrate SQL + Python integration for data analysis

## 🗂 Dataset

The dataset includes the following columns:

Order ID

Amount

Profit

Quantity

Category

Sub-Category

Payment Mode

Order Date

Customer Name

State

City

Year-Month

## 🧹 Data Cleaning

Converted column names to snake_case

Renamed inconsistent columns

Converted date columns to proper date format

Ensured numeric columns are numeric

Removed rows with missing values

## 🐍 Python Steps

Import libraries (sqlite3, pandas, matplotlib)

Load CSV and clean data

Insert data into SQLite

Run SQL query

Display results using pandas

Plot revenue by category

## 📦 Technologies Used

Python

SQLite

Pandas

Matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook

## 🏁 Conclusion

This project shows how Python and SQL can work together to analyze sales data efficiently. With SQL handling aggregation and Python handling visualization, the workflow becomes powerful and flexible for data analysis tasks.
